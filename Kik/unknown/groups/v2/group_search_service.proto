//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Service Interfaces
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------

//
// Mobile-facing service allowing users to search for public groups.
// This provides a mechanism for mobile clients to discover existing public groups.
//
// This list is filtered in a number of ways with the intention of providing a
// better search experience for the user. Ideally it should provide groups that:
// (1) Are relevant to the search string entered
// (2) Are immediately join-able
// (3) Are "clean" (i.e. not X-rated or otherwise offensive)
//
service GroupSearch {
    //
    // Returns a list of groups based on the request parameters provided.
    // This method is called directly by clients as they are entering text into
    // the client search field.
    //
    // Initial expectations is that this query is doing a simple prefix search
    // of group hashtags.  Future revisions will search additional fields such
    // as group name, and potentially allow multiple terms
    //
    // Notes:
    // * Rate Limiting: This method is rate limited per-user.  Initial settings
    //   will be limited to no more than 100 queries per minute.
    // * Result Order: If there is an exact match of a hashtag to the provided
    //   search query, it will always be listed as the first match.  Remaining
    //   results are in order of relevance, and should be displayed to the user
    //   in that order.
    // * Creation Flag: If there is not exact hashtag match, the response will
    //   indicate if the exact search query could be used as a public group
    //   hashtag for a new group creation.  It may be false if the term searched
    //   matches existing blacklist/filtering systems, or if a group with that
    //   hashtag was previously terminated.
    //
    rpc FindGroups(FindGroupsRequest) returns (FindGroupsResponse) {}

    // Provides a set of suggested group search terms
    // Notes:
    // * Terms ordering: This method makes no guarantees as to the order of the suggested terms
    //   provided.  While unlikely, the order may appear different from one request to the next.
    // * Response size: This method will return as many as 100 suggestions.  If the list is too large for display,
    //   the client is expected to arbitrarily (or randomly) select a subset from this list.
